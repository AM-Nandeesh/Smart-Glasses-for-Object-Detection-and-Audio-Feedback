# Smart-Glasses-for-Object-Detection-and-Audio-Feedback

Working on an ongoing project called ”The Sanjay Effect:
Smart Glasses for Object Detection and Audio Feedback” which aims to develop smart glasses that detect objects in real-time and
provide audio feedback to aid the visually impaired(Blind People). Using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm
and other machine learning techniques, the project captures video from a camera mounted on the spectacles and processes it to
identify objects in the user’s surroundings. The system then provides audio feedback to the user through speakers mounted on the
spectacles.
Tech: OpenCV, Python, YOLO, Computer Vision
